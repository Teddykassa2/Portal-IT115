       <p>Hello everyone, thank you for taking your time to visit my page. My name is Tedrose Kassa. 

        I am an emerging Software Developer here at Year Up. For the past five and a half years, I have 
        
        been working as a resident manager at an adult foster home. Some of the skills that I was able 
        
        to develop from being a caregiver are managing and taking care of young adults with 
        
        developmental disabilities. patience whenever there is a challenge. Being punctual when 
        
        working on  a 
        
        project. Being respectful of people's time by communicating progress to let the supervisor 
        
        know the time frame of a project. Performing under pressure staying calm and being respectful 
        
        are some other skills I developed during my time working as a resident manager. Fast forward 
        
        to June 2021, I started an online course through Coursera partnered with google for a Data 
        
        analytic certificate. Through this course, I got analytic skills which include critical thinking, 
        
        analyzing and manipulating data, working with Spreadsheets, SQL queries, and programming R 
        
         to analyze and share data visualization made with Pivot table, Tableau, or R to make 
        
        data-driven decisions. I have been taking Application Development classes here at Year Up and I have a basic knowledge of HTML and GitHub so far in the past four weeks. As well as business professional writing and communication skills. I will be ready to be an intern with all of the professional skills I got, in six months time.</p>
